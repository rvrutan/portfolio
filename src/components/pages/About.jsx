        I am Veysel Yalin (Roni), a highly motivated and results-oriented
        individual eager to transition into the dynamic field of software
        development.
        <br /> With a proven track record of success as a Construction Project
        Manager for over six years, I possess exceptional project management,
        problem-solving, and team collaboration skills. My experience in
        successfully delivering numerous projects has instilled in me a strong
        work ethic, attention to detail, and the ability to thrive in fast-paced
        environments. <br />I am a quick learner and a dedicated team player,
        eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a challenging and
        rewarding role in software development. I have already embarked on my
        software development journey with the successful completion of projects
        such as the Weather Dashboard.
